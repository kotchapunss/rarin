# Image Setup Instructions

## Adding the Intro Image

1. Save the RARIN building image as `rarin-intro.jpg` in the `/public` folder
2. The image should be placed at: `/Users/Kotchapun.S/Documents/workspace/rarin/public/rarin-intro.jpg`

## How the Animation Works

- The intro animation shows for 2 seconds
- Then fades out over 0.5 seconds
- After fading out, the main app with the event type selector appears
- The animation only plays once when the app first loads

## Image Requirements

- **Filename**: `rarin-intro.jpg`
- **Location**: `/public/` directory
- **Format**: JPEG recommended (but PNG, WebP also work)
- **Recommended size**: 1920x1080 or similar landscape aspect ratio
- The image will be automatically centered and sized to fit the screen
